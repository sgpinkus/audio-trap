  + I'm using qDebug for informational logging. Works but shit when you actually need to use qDebug() for debug.
  + "default:" and some other devices make QAudioRecorder freeze up indefinitely. Added lot of code to try and avoid but still happens.
  + Add tail out time options to UI.
  + Add dpkg build notes or script.
